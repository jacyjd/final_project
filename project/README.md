# Guessing Country Names!

In this game, two players will guess a letter that might be in the mystery country name. The fun of this daily game is for players to race their friends guessing a country name. After 3 failed attempts at guessing the country name, it is a second player's time to guess. After both players get three failed attempts at guessing the word, or guess correctly, the game will end. 

## How to play

Two players will guess letters in the chosen mystery word. After entering in the letter in the mystery word, the program will confirm if that letter is or is not in the mystery word. Turns will flip after one player's entire turn after they run out of tries or if they correctly guess the word. Each player will receive a point for each letter guess they enter. The program will not tell players where the correctly guessed letter is in the mystery word. The program will tell players how many times the correctly guessed letter is in mystery word. The program will track each player's number of points. The player with the smallest number of letter guesses before correctly guessing the word will win the game. The program will keep track of the scores and plots them at the end of the game!
## How to run the program

The Guessing Words Game is used for players to guess a randomized word. As a player you can run the program in VScode.
