# Guessing Country Names!

In this game, two players will go back and forth guessing a letter that might be in the mystery word. This game is soon-to-be in the New York Times Games, where each day the mystery topic is a secret for players. Today's theme is name of a country...however players do not know this. The fun of this daily game is for players to race their friends guessing a random mystery word with an unknown topic. After a certain times of failed attempts at guessing the word, the game will end. 

## How to play

Two players will go back and forth guessing letters in the chosen mystery word. After entering in the letter in the mystery word, the program will confirm if that letter is or is not in the mystery word. Turns will flip back and forth between players until they run out of tries or if they correctly guess the word. Each player will receive a point for each letter guess they enter. The program will not tell players where the correctly guessed letter is in the mystery word. The program will tell players how many times the correctly guessed letter is in mystery word. The program will track each player's number of points. The player with the smallest number of letter guesses before correctly guessing the word will win the game. 
## How to run the program

The Guessing Words Game is used for players to guess a randomized word. As a player you can run the program in VScode.
